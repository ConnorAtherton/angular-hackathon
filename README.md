# Angular hackathon
### An opinionated node project boilerplate for angular applications.

## TODO
- The gulpfile is quite buggy and I haven't figured out why yet
- Make it look better
- Add flash messages that are emitted to the client
- Add websockets as a default service
- Enable login through github and other popular sites
- Starting adding external apis like Stripe (design similiar to segment.io)

## API keys
It's bad practice to check in api keys using git. I've provided them in this project
so you can get up and running quickly and to verify that authentiction/authorisation
does work.
